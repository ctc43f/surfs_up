# Surfs Up Temperature Analysis

## Overview of Analysis

Mr. Avy has asked us to look at the months of June and December, specifically the temperatures in both months, to help him determine whether or not to invest in the surf shop.  Presumably, he assumes that the month of December might be the coldest to look at and June the warmest for Hawaii.  Another consideration might be that both are popular times for people to vacation and he wants to determine if weather might hamper attracting tourists to visit the surf shop.

*** The purpose of the analysis is to look at the summary statistics for June and December temperatures and describe additional analysis that could be done to assist W.Avy in his decision ***
